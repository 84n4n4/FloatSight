# FloatSight
An Android app for visualizing [**FlySight**](http://flysight.ca/) GPS tracker data.

## Requirements
To open files directly from a FlySight -
* Your Android device has to support USB-Host / USB On-The-Go.
* You need an USB-OTG cable.

## Connecting to the FlySight
To connect your FlySight -
* Connect your Android device with your FlySight using an OTG cable.
* Change USB option (accessible via notifications bar) to "File transfer". (Give it a few seconds.)
* You can either open the track files directly in FloatSight, or copy them to your SD-card first (with the file manager app of your choice) to have them available even after you disconnect your FlySight.
* Don't Forget to properly eject your FlySight before disonnecting the cable. This is also done via the notification bar. (If no eject option is visible there, swipe down on the Android System notification for USB drive.) 

You can of course copy FlySight track files from other sources (email, download, copy from other device) to your mobiles storage and then use FloatSight to load them.

* Short tap on a yellow marker dismisses the marker.
* Long tap on this yellow marker sets this as a range start/end.
* The blue range marker averages and differentials of data within this range.
